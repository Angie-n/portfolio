                <p>Hi there, my name is Angie Nguyen and I’m currently a UCSD student majoring in computer science. I believe the best way to learn is through getting hands-on experience, and so I’m always eager to work on new projects. While I have the self-drive to learn on my own and follow through on solo projects, I am always looking for opportunities to get involved. Feel free to contact me if you think I’d be a good fit for your project!</p>
